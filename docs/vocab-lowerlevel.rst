Low-Level Vocabulary
====================

These methods provide a lower-level abstraction of the API. Basically, they
simply provide standard GET, POST, DELETE and PUT functionality. You will
need to provide information such as API path. If your needs are a bit simpler,
use the :doc:`vocab-highlevel`.
